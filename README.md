Hello! This is the first game I have attempted making in Godot and I am fairly proud of how it turned out, especially for a 5-day project over spring break

The two folders available are the raw files for the project and a Zip file of the executable plus all other necessary files to play the game. The "betaRelease.zip" is the folder you should download if you wanna play the game. Also it's only working on Windows atm, so sorry about that 

I hope you enjoy! :)
