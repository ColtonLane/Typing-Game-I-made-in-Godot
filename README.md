Hello! This is the first game I have attempted making in Godot and I am fairly proud of how it turned out, especially for a 5-day project over spring break

There is a playble version in-browser hosted on my GitHub Pages (accessable also by games.coltonlane.me) and a downloadable windows version via the BetaRelese.zip. Any feedback about this game is greatly appreciated!

I hope you enjoy! :)
